Release FlapwMBPT.2106

As compared to previous version, new default system has been developed.
As a result, input file format is completely new and simple to use.
Also, LAPW basis set has been optimized (PRB 103, 165101)

Both changes resulted in considerable work for updating the code.

Features available for use:

LDA, GGA (including atomic forces)
Hartre-Fock approximation
QSGW (self-consistent quasiparticle GW approach)
scGW (self-consistent GW)
sc(GW+G3W2) - first order vertex corrected GW (scheme B in PRB 94, 155101)
sc(BSE:P$GW+G3W2) - BSE for polarizability and first order vertex correction for self energy (scheme G in PRB 94, 155101)


Under developing:

Susceptibilities (updating)
Other vertex corrected schemes (updating)
